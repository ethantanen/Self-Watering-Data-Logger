# Self-Watering-Data-Logger
This is a project run by an Arduino Uno using various sensors to detect air and soil temperatures and humidity. The data is logged to an SD card but also sent via serial through an HC-06 Bluetooth Module and the data is read by Python... or should be.  So far, I have read data from simple programs into both a command prompt using Python and a Tera Term console window. However, when trying to send data from my larger project, I get nothing.
